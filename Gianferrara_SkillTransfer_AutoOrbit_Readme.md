DATA & FILE OVERVIEW

1. ACT-R - Folder containing the 3 different ACT-R models (*.lisp) that were used to generate the paper data using act-r-sf on the lab cluster

2. "Transfer_Scores_Humans.txt" - Summary of 80 human subjects' scores across conditions

3. All_code - Folder containing all the relevant scripts that were used to a] generate measure files from raw event files (time series with relevant game events based on log files), b] generate R table for statistical analyses, c] run statistical analyses in R
Please check out "Code_Instructions.md" under the "All_code" folder for further information on how to run preprocessing analyses
