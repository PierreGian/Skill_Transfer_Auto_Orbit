DATA & FILE OVERVIEW

1. ACT-R - Folder containing the 3 different ACT-R models (*.lisp) that were used to generate the paper data using act-r-sf on the lab cluster. The 3 models are as follows:

1.1 "MS17_Baseline_cluster.lisp" - Baseline ACT-R model (2 trackers & 1 temperature)

1.2 "MS17_1tracker_cluster.lisp" - ACT-R model with tracker manipulation (1 tracker only & 1 temperature)

1.3 "MS17_notemp_cluster.lisp" - ACT-R model with temperature manipulation (2 trackers & 2 temperatures)

2. Skill_Transfer_Auto_Orbit - Folder containing all the code for the Cognitive & Motor Skill Transfer project. You will find the two following items:

2.1 "Transfer_Scores_Humans.txt" - Summary of 80 human subjects' scores across the 4 conditions: HHH, HLH, LHL, LLL

2.2 All_code - Folder containing all the relevant scripts that were used to 
a] generate measure files from raw event files (relevant game events based on log files)
b] generate R table for statistical analyses
c] run statistical analyses in R
Please check out "Code_Instructions.txt" under the "All_code" folder for further information on how to run preprocessing analyses
